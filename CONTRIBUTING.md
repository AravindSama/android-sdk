Simply create a branch off of `master`.  When the work on the branch is complete make a pull request.  Pull requests should be squashed and merged into `devel`.

All branches will be built and run against the entire test suite on Travis with every commit.  

The `test-app` module is built against a real Optimizely project.  Changing the project ID will cause tests to fail.  The test app should be used as a reference.
