### Android Studio

Android Studio is an IDE that wraps gradle (and `adb`).  Everything you can do in Android Studio can be done from command line with gradle and the other android command line tools.  

You can import this project into Android Studio by opening Android Studio and selecting `Import Project` from the first dialog or from the `File` menu.  Simply select the project's root `build.gradle` file and Android Studio will do the rest.

Tests can be run by right clicking the file in the project pane or by clicking the method name in source and selecting run.  You will be prompted to create an AVD or connect a device if one isn't connected.
